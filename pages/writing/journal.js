          Americans don't seem to know how to deal with struggle anymore. There was a gas shortage in the South East, and
          the immediate reponse on behalf of the citizens was to stockpile gas - every man for themselves.
          Something about the obese couple in an SUV hoarding 100 gallons of gas back home
          was very unaesthetic.

        <p>
          Perhaps asceticism will come back. It seems in the most materially prosperous society in world history that the
          only way to survive is to manufacture struggle artificially. Or perhaps Nietzsche was correct, and we should
          go about turning society into something more primitive and cruel. Either way, it seems that material prosperity leads
          to human cattle farming - proliferation of the lowest and ugliest life: a 40 year old single man eating hardened corn
          syrup, watching "adult cartoons," hitting the bong before taking a nap and masturbating to fetish porn. This is the
          last man. This is the ideal citizen at the apex of capitalism: a cow. He eats, sleeps, consooms, and doesn't cause too
          much trouble.

          I can understand why all those upper-middle class muslim kids went to join ISIS last decade.
          This past week, there was something life affirming about watching Arabs and Jews run from the rockets. 
          I envy them.

          It only makes sense in a world where art (and those consooming it) is incredibly shallow. Only when the artist
          is producing meaninless <i>art pour l'art</i> does it come under the juristiction of the audience to decide what
          it means. Nietzsche said that Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being misunderstood.
          Strauss too.

          Let me explore this in the context of meme culture, something all can understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm embedded in particular esoteric meme cultures. It would take hours to explain some of them. They are very
          intentional and layered with lots of particular symbols understood by the in-group. They are not "merely aesthetic"
          experiences. There is a tradition of ideological, allegorical, layered meaning, and structure conducive to great art.
          However, memes are still extremely crude. You wouldn't want to frame one. Yet, there is
          no doubt in my mind that great artists went through the same process we do when we make esoteric memes. I will never
          fully understand a Bosch
          painting. His art are probably layered with the same kind of esoteric symbols I enjoy in my memes. It's a lost tradition,
          a lost culture. I can marvel at it, but I'll never "get it" fully. I know that some people will never get my memes. Cultures
          die.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when some midwit 110 iq comes and proclaims "death of the author" - it is true only insofar as they are consuming shallow
          art with no inherent meaning. All "merely aesthetic" experiences are open to interpretation. Everyone sees something
          different when they do drugs - same with trashy art. But my memes are different. Bosch is different. There is meaning in them,
          but the unwashed masses aren't allowed to know.

      <JournalPost date="5-15-21" title="Modernism is Aesthetic Liberalism">
        <p>
          Modernism is the projection of liberalism onto art. Every ideology aspouses
          a particular aim and purpose, projecting its beliefs onto art. In the case of liberalism, we call it
          modernism. The largest political deviations from liberalism - mainly communism and fascism in the 20th century - had art
          very distinct from the modern. The Nazis embraced&nbsp;
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_in_Nazi_Germany">classical beauty</a>, and the communists&nbsp;
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism">realism</a>.
        </p>
        <img src="/nazi.jpeg" style={{maxHeight: "300px"}}/>
        <p>
          Today, "modern art" is basically a euphemism for pretentious garbage that must be mocked. However, I think it is
          more accurate to label this kind of art "post-modern." Artists through the end of the 60s largely still believed
          in the liberal project.&nbsp;
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock">Pollock</a> represents human freedom,&nbsp;
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol">Warhol</a> material comfort,&nbsp;
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko">Rothko</a> the flattening of the Earth.&nbsp;
          By the early 70s, America had lost this
          belief, and began to look back on these works as flat, empty, and meaningless.
        </p>  
        <img src="/pollock.jpeg" />
        <p>
          In time, we stumbled into post-modernism - rather than an overcoming of modernism,
          seemed to just indulge in its worst aspects: the meaninglessness, the ugliness, <i>art pour l'art</i>. I see no course
          correction anytime soon. Before we can have another great culture - we need a purpose for our society. Perhaps it will
          come from Christ - or perhaps a Napoleon. My personal preference is a Napoleon.

      <JournalPost date="5-14-21" title="Culture: Atoms vs Bits">
        <p>
          Both Peter Thiel and Bruno Maçães talk about the pivot from atoms to bits in the early 70s. Thiel's famous quote is&nbsp;
          <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/client/snv?noteGuid=46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2&noteKey=7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&sn=https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/sh/46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2/7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&title=That+Essay">
            we wanted flying cars, and all we got was 140 characters,
          </a>"
          a declaration of our failure to realize the sci-fi future. We (may) have the Star-Trek
          computer, but we have no warp drive, no space travel, our lifespans are decreasing, and we lack energy and food needed
          to reach escape velocity. The digital revolution continues, but innovation has failed very miserably in the world of atoms.
          </p>
          <p>
          Maçães has a similar claim, but in the domain of politics. He says&nbsp;
            <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/american-magical-realism">
              America is one giant theme park.
            </a>
          &nbsp;Our political culture is entirely fake. There are no Nazis, nor any communist
          revolutionaries. "In a capitalist world, violent debates about truth interefere with the productive act of commerce."
          There is no war, no thrilling adventure, no threat to our existence - and yet we are consumed by media
          that makes us live as though this is true. Maybe it's a sitcom, or maybe a reality TV show, or maybe the WWE, or maybe
          a disaster movie - but it is not reality - it is virtual reality. No one takes real risk in America -
          we are far too cowardly. 
          </p>
          <img src="/thiel.jpeg" />
          <p>
          To these two points, I would like to add that our art and cultural
          production are also all entirely virutal. Any art that requires a physical presence to be experienced - a painting 
          in a gallery, a sculpture in a garden, or a building downtown - is dead. It seems that we still have great movies every 
          once in a while, great music and videogames too - but when was the last 
          time we collectively venerated a painting? A sculputre? A beautiful new building? It simply doesn't happen anymore.
          Atoms are dead. We have collectively decided that bits are the future in politics, technology, and culture - though
          this seems to have come at the price of self-stultification: a decrease in our ambition, ability, and aspiration
          towards higher things.
