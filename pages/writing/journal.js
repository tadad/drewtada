          Americans don't seem to know how to deal with struggle anymore. 
          One of the mythical periods in American history is the great depression - where times were tough, 
          but everyone pulled through. Whether or not the legend is true, we have to contrast it with today.
          There was a gas shortage in the South East, and
          the immediate reponse on behalf of the citizens was to stockpile gas - every man for themselves.
          Something about the obese couples, in their SUVs, hoarding thousands of gallons of gas back home
          was very unaesthetic.

          Perhaps asceticism will come back. It seems - in the most materially prosperous society in world history - that the
          only way to survive is to manufacture struggle artificially. Or perhaps Nietzsche was correct, and we should
          go about turning society into something more primitive and cruel. Either way, it seems that material prosperity leads
          to human cattle farming - proliferation of the lowest and ugliest life: a 40 year old single man eating hardened corn
          syrup, watching "adult cartoons," hitting the bong before taking a nap and masturbating to fetish porn. This is the
          last man. This is the ideal consoomer at the apex of capitalism. He is a cow. He eats, sleeps, consooms, and doesn't cause too
          much trouble.

          I can understand why all those upper-middle class muslim kids went to join ISIS last decade.
          This past week, there was something life affirming about watching Arabs and Jews run from the rockets. 
          I envy them.

          It only makes sense in a world where art (and those consooming it) is incredibly shallow. Only when the artist
          is producing meaninless <i>art pour l'art</i> does it come under the juristiction of the audience to decide what
          it means. Nietzsche said that Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than misunderstood.
          Strauss too.

          Let me explore this in the context of meme culture, something all can understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm embedded in particular esoteric meme cultures. It would take hours to explain some of them. They are very
          intentional and layered with lots of particular symbols understood by the in-group. They are not "merely aesthetic"
          experiences. There is a tradition of ideological, allegorical, layered meaning, and structure. They are too crude to
          be capital-A Art, but there is
          no doubt in my mind that great artists communicate the same way we do when we create our esoteric memes.
          I will fully understand a Bosch
          painting. His art is layered with the same kind of esoteric symbols I enjoy in my memes. It's a lost tradition,
          a lost culture. I can marvel at it, but I'll never "get it" fully. I know that some people will never get my memes. Cultures
          die. But to suggest that there was no specific intention behind his brushstrokes is retarded.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when some midwit 110 iq comes and proclaims "death of the author" - it is true only insofar as they are consuming shallow
          art with no inherent meaning. All "merely aesthetic" experiences are open to interpretation. Everyone sees something
          different when they do drugs - same with trashy art. But my memes are different. Bosch is different. There is meaning in them,
          but the unwashed masses aren't allowed to know.

      <JournalPost date="5-15-21" title="Modernism is Aesthetic Liberalism">
        <p>
          Every ideology aspouses a particular aim and purpose, projecting its beliefs onto art. Modernism is the projection of liberalism onto art.
          The various movements, from Romanticism, Impressionism, all the way to Abstract Expressionism,
          were projections of that period's flavor of liberalism onto art. I'll save a deeper analysis for a
          later time. For now, consider that the largest political deviations from liberalism in the 20th century - communism and 
          fascism - had distinct, non-modern, art styles. The Nazis embraced&nbsp;
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_in_Nazi_Germany">classical beauty</a>, and the communists&nbsp;
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism">realism</a>.
        </p>
        <img src="/nazi.jpeg" style={{maxHeight: "300px"}}/>
        <p>
          Today, "modern art" is basically a euphemism for pretentious garbage that must be mocked. However, I think it is
          more accurate to label this art "post-modern." Artists through the end of the 60s largely still believed
          in the liberal project.&nbsp;
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock">Pollock</a> is human freedom,&nbsp;
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol">Warhol</a> material comfort,&nbsp;
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko">Rothko</a> the flattening of the Earth.&nbsp;
          By the early 70s, America had lost faith in these ideas
          belief, and began to look back on this art as flat, empty, and meaningless.
        </p>

        <p>
          In time, we stumbled into post-modernism - rather than an overcoming of modernism,
          it seemed to indulge in its worst aspects: the meaninglessness, the ugliness, the subjectivity - in short,
          <i>art pour l'art</i>. I don't think we have corrected course since. We have no ambition because  we
          do not know why we are together. We do not know what we are building, or why we would want to build anything.
          Before we can have great art and culture, we need a purpose for our society. The&nbsp;
          <a href="https://palladiummag.com/2018/09/29/towards-the-post-liberal-synthesis/">post-liberal thesis</a> must
          come together before we truly overcome modern art.

      <JournalPost date="5-14-21" title="Culture: Atoms vs Bits">
        <p>
          Both Peter Thiel and Bruno Maçães talk about the pivot from atoms to bits in the early 70s. Thiel's famous quote is&nbsp;
          <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/client/snv?noteGuid=46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2&noteKey=7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&sn=https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/sh/46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2/7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&title=That+Essay">
            we wanted flying cars, and all we got was 140 characters,
          </a>"
          a declaration of our failure to realize the sci-fi future. We (may) have the Star-Trek
          computer, but we have no warp drive, no space travel, our lifespans are decreasing, and we lack energy and food needed
          to reach escape velocity. The digital revolution continues, but innovation has failed very miserably in the world of atoms.
          </p>
          <p>
          Maçães has a similar claim, but in the domain of politics. He says&nbsp;
            <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/american-magical-realism">
              America is one giant theme park.
            </a>
          &nbsp;Our political culture is entirely fake. There are no Nazis, nor any communist
          revolutionaries. "In a capitalist world, violent debates about truth interefere with the productive act of commerce."
          There is no war, no thrilling adventure, no threat to our existence - and yet we are consumed by media
          that makes us live as though this is true. Maybe it's a sitcom, or maybe a reality TV show, or maybe the WWE, or maybe
          a disaster movie - but it is not reality - it is virtual reality. No one takes real risk in America -
          we are far too cowardly. 
          </p>
          <img src="/thiel.jpeg" />
          <p>
          To these two points, I would like to add that our art and cultural
          production are also all entirely virutal. Any art that requires a physical presence to be experienced - a painting 
          in a gallery, a sculpture in a garden, or a building downtown - is dead. It seems that we still have great movies every 
          once in a while, great music and videogames too - but when was the last 
          time we collectively venerated a painting? A sculputre? A beautiful new building? It simply doesn't happen anymore.
          Atoms are dead. We have collectively decided that bits are the future in politics, technology, and culture - though
          this seems to have come at the price of self-stultification: a decrease in our ambition, ability, and aspiration
          towards higher things.
