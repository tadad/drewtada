      <h2>Life Affirmation</h2>
      <p>
        Americans don't seem to know how to deal with struggle anymore. There was a gas shortage in the South East, and
        the immediate reponse on behalf of the citizens was to stockpile gas - every man for themselves.
        Something about the obese couple in an SUV hoarding 100 gallons of gas back home
        was very unaesthetic. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps asceticism will come back. In the most materially prosperous society in world history - the
        only way to survive is to manufacture your own struggles artificially. Or perhaps Nietzsche was correct, and we should
        go about turning society into something more primitive and cruel. Either way, it seems that material prosperity leads
        to human cattle farming - proliferation of the lowest and ugliest life: a 40 year old single man eating hardened corn
        syrup, watching "adult cartoons," hitting the bong before taking a nap and masturbating to fetish porn. This is the
        last man. This is the ideal citizen at the apex of capitalism: a cow. He eats, sleeps, consooms, and doesn't cause too
        much trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can understand why all those upper-middle class muslim kids went to join ISIS last decade.
        This past week, there was something life affirming about watching Arabs and Jews run from the rockets. I envy them. 
        Many share this feeling.

      <h3>On Irony</h3>
      <p>
        Irony is pretending to protest without actually doing anything. Someone called irony a bird that sings
        about its cage: it sings about how it doesn't like it, but it really does like the cage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Citizens of cyberspace really like their cage then. We've added more and more layers to the irony.
        The culture is getting more and more complex, but its foundations are entirely meaningless. Even the things that
        people purport to take seriously - various ideologies, religions, and political movements - are now being soaked
        in ironic meme culture. It is as if we are just pretending to be serious - like we were meant to act out a character
        in a given movie. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some say that if you LARP hard enough, eventually it becomes real. I disagree. On the outside of the LARP, anyone
        can see that it is fake. It is just that some LARP communities have gotten so large that we take it for base
        reality. American politics as world's largest LARP.&nbsp;
        <a href="https://paulskallas.substack.com/p/politics-is-pro-wrestling">Politics is pro wrestling</a>.
        We already live in reality TV, virtual reality, whatever you want to callit. It is hell.

      <h3>Death of the Author is a Theory for Midwits</h3>
      <p>
        It only makes sense in a world where art (and those consooming it) is incredibly shallow. Only when the artist
        is producing meaninless <i>art pour l'art</i> does it come under the juristiction of the audience to decide what
        it means. Nietzsche said that Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being misunderstood.
        I think Strauss' message was similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm embedded in particular esoteric meme cultures. It would take hours to explain some of them. They are very
        intentional and layered with lots of particular symbols understood by the in-group. They are not "merely aesthetic"
        experiences. There is a tradition of ideological, allegorical, layered meaning, and structure conducive to great art.
        However, memes are still extremely crude. You wouldn't want to frame one. Yet, there is
        no doubt in my mind that great artists went through the same process we do when we make esoteric memes. I will never
        fully understand a Rembrandt, or a Bosch
        painting. Their art are probably layered with the same kind of esoteric symbols I enjoy in my memes. It's a lost tradition,
        a lost culture. I can marvel at it, but I'll never "get it" fully. I know that some people will never get my memes. Cultures
        die.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when some midwit 110 iq comes and proclaims "death of the author" - it is true only insofar as they are consuming shallow
        art with no inherent meaning. All "merely aesthetic" experiences are open to interpretation. Everyone sees something
        different when they do drugs - same with trashy art. But my memes are different. Bosch is different. There is meaning in them,
        but the unwashed masses aren't allowed to know.

      <h3>Modernism is Aesthetic Liberalism</h3>
      <p>
        Modernism is the projection of liberalism onto art. Every ideology aspouses
        a particular aim and purpose, projecting its beliefs onto art. In the case of liberalism, we call it
        modernism. The largest political deviations from liberalism - mainly communism and fascism in the 20th century - had art
        very distinct from the modern. The Nazis embraced&nbsp;
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_in_Nazi_Germany">classical beauty</a>, and the communists&nbsp;
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism">realism</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, "modern art" is basically a euphemism for pretentious garbage that must be mocked. However, I think it is
        more accurate to label this kind of art "post-modern." Artists through the end of the 60s largely still believed
        in the liberal project. Pollock represents human freedom; Harrington the universalism of humanity under one banner; 
        Warhol the material comforts; and Rothko the flattening of the Earth. By the early 70s, America had lost this
        belief, and began to look back on these works as flat, empty, and meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
        In time, we stumbled into post-modernism - rather than an overcoming of modernism,
        seemed to just indulge in its worst aspects: the meaninglessness, the ugliness, <i>art pour l'art</i>. I see no course
        correction anytime soon. Before we can have another great culture - we need a purpose for our society. Perhaps it will
        come from Christ - or perhaps a Napoleon. My personal preference is Napoleon.

      <h2>Culture: Atoms vs Bits</h2>
      <p>
        Both Peter Thiel and Bruno Maçães talk about the pivot from atoms to bits in the early 70s. Thiel's famous quote is&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/client/snv?noteGuid=46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2&noteKey=7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&sn=https://www.evernote.com/shard/s542/sh/46c636b6-b404-45df-ab0a-1f84c6fdc8c2/7c94233539b8258d72b395a063f3c589&title=That+Essay">
          we wanted flying cars, and all we got was 140 characters,
        </a>"
        a declaration of our failure to realize the sci-fi future. We (may) have the Star-Trek
        computer, but we have no warp drive, no space travel, our lifespans are decreasing, and we lack energy and food needed
        to reach escape velocity. The digital revolution continues, but innovation has failed very miserably in the world of atoms.
        </p>
        <p>
        Maçães has a similar claim, but in the domain of politics. He says&nbsp;
          <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/american-magical-realism">
            America is one giant theme park.
          </a>
        &nbsp;Our political culture is entirely fake. There are no Nazis, nor any communist
        revolutionaries. "In a capitalist world, violent debates about truth interefere with the productive act of commerce."
        There is no war, no thrilling adventure, no threat to our existence - and yet we are consumed by media
        that makes us live as though this is true. Maybe it's a sitcom, or maybe a reality TV show, or maybe the WWE, or maybe
        a disaster movie - but it is not reality - it is virtual reality. No one takes real risk in America -
        we are far too cowardly. 
        </p>
        <p>
        To these two points, I would like to add that our art and cultural
        production are also all entirely virutal. Any art that requires a physical presence to be experienced - a painting 
        in a gallery, a sculpture in a garden, or a building downtown - is dead. It seems that we still have great movies every 
        once in a while, great music and videogames too - but when was the last 
        time we collectively venerated a painting? A sculputre? A beautiful new building? It simply doesn't happen anymore.
        Atoms are dead. We have collectively decided that bits are the future in politics, technology, and culture - though
        this seems to have come at the price of self-stultification: a decrease in our ambition, ability, and aspiration
        towards higher things.
