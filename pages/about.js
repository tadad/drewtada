        It seems the era of the personal site is dead, no? Remnants of the old ways remain on archaic sites,
        most swept away by the tide of [MEGACORP]. And much like the earthquakes,
        fires, and other disasters which have destroyed most ancient knowledge, link rot has left us with few remnants
        of the early internet.

        It goes without saying that the 
        internet is the platform where culture is minted in the 21st century. Now that we are a quarter century out
        from mainstream adoption of the web that, we can start to do some serious reflection. In some ways it is still too
        close. Either way, internet archaeology is inevitable, so why not start now?

        I'm attempting to do some history of the early internet, looking for signs of revival. The West is in an era of 
        cultural decline, though it is clear that the seeds of somthing great are being planted in cyberspace.
        Most of it has stayed in cyberspace. One day it will become real, but when? How long do we have to wait?
        The world of atoms is strangled by so many factors, and all of the energy is being channeled into various
        cyberspatial forms. We wanted beautiful buildings, but all we got were beautful Minecraft palaces. We are already living in 
        virtual reality, but it is not good enough. Blockchain has gotten reasonably far in making digital currencies real (
          thought money is the perfect virtual good - finance is a virutal industry.
        ). The virtual is replacing the virtual. But the virtual is an imperfect substitute for the real. I want beautiful cities
        in real life - not just in the Sims.

        I'm interested in reviving the culture. Fine Art has been dead for close to 100 years. Most of this has been offset
        by great films, television, videogames, and music. The momentum in media has shifted strongly from atoms to bits. Once,
        we were able to build great buildings, and erect great statues, but today, no one feels free to undertake
        such a task. The world we live in is where everything beautiful is not real, and everything real is not beautiful.
        We live in a virutal reality. Everything is Dionysian chaos. Anyone that wants to build something IRL
        doesn't have the f
